<p>I am an aspiring web developer and a Computer Science student at Ashesi University, where I am building strong foundational skills in programming, problem-solving, and software design. I am passionate about using technology to create real-world solutions, especially in education and community development.
I specialize in front-end web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I am continuously learning how to build more interactive and efficient websites. My focus is on writing clean, well-structured code and designing responsive websites that work seamlessly across devices.
